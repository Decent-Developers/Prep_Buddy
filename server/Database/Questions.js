        "question": "Which of the following characteristics represents ‘Inheritance of blood groups’ in humans?",
        "options": ["I. Dominance", "II. Co-dominance", "III. Multiple allele", "IV. Incomplete dominance", "V. Polygenic inheritance"],
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "IAIO, IBIO –Dominant – recessive relationship, IAIB – Codominance, IA, IB & IO – Three different allelic forms of a gene (multiple allelism)."

        "question": "Which of the following most appropriately describes haemophilia?",
        "options": ["A. Recessive gene disorder", "B. X – linked recessive gene disorder", "C. Chromosomal disorder", "D. Dominant gene disorder"],
        "correct": "B",
        "explanation": "Haemophilia A and haemophilia B are inherited in an X – linked recessive pattern. The genes associated with these conditions are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, it is very rare for females to have haemophilia. A characteristic of X – linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X – linked traits to their sons."

    {
        "question": "A pleiotropic gene:",
        "options": ["A. Is a gene evolved during Pliocene", "B. Controls a trait only in combination with another gene", "C. Controls multiple traits in an individual", "D. Is expresses only in primitive plants."],
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "A pleiotropic gene regulates multiple traits (characteristic) in an individual."

    {
        "question": "In our society women are blamed for producing female children. Choose the correct answer for the sex-determination in humans.",
        "options": ["A. Due to some defect in the women", "B. Due to some defect like aspermia in man", "C. Due to the genetic make-up of the particular sperm which fertilizes the egg", "D. Due to the genetic make-up of the egg"],
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "In case of humans, the sex determining mechanism is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosome, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females called autosomes. A pair of X chromosomes is present in the female, whereas the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of male characteristic. In case the ovum fertilizes with a sperm carrying X chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilization of ovum with Y chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring."

    {
        "question": "Which traits in humans is an example of multiple alleles?",
        "options": ["A. Eye color", "B. Skin color", "C. ABO blood group", "D. Rh blood group"],
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "ABO blood group is the first discovered multiple allelic blood groups system in humans. This system has 4 different phenotypes which are distinct from each other on basis of specific antigens on surface of RBC."

    {
        "question": "Human have which of the following sex determining type?",
        "options": ["A. XO-XX", "B. XY-XX", "C. ZZ-ZW", "D. None of the above"],
        "correct": "B",
        "explanation": "Humans have XY-XX sex determining type in which the males determine the sex of the child."

    {
        "question": "Which of the following trait is transmitted directly from father to son?",
        "options": ["A. Autosomal dominant", "B. Autosomal recessive", "C. X-linked", "D. Y-linked"],
        "correct": "D",
        "explanation": "Y-linked trait is transmitted from father to son directly as Y gene is received by son only."

    {
        "question": "Mendel’s perform series of experiments on pea plant because it’s _________?",
        "options": ["A. Flowers were hermaphrodite", "B. Had sharply distinct trait", "C. Self-fertilization is easy", "D. All of above"],
        "correct": "D",
        "explanation": "Self Explanatory"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the pathophysiology in hemophilia?",
        "options": ["A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation", "B. Thromboembolism", "C. Blood fails to clot after an injury", "D. Increase viscosity of blood"],
        "correct": "C",
        "explanation": "In hemophilia blood fails to clot due to reduction or complete absence of clotting factor."
